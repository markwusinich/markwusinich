MRS. NEEDLEMAN - Julie’s mother. Oy.

ACT 1
A sparse set. Whatever the place you held auditions for this show is what the set area
should look like. Perhaps the back of some flats lying around. Odd furniture, etc. Only the
“readings” should be done on the stage area. Most of the action is outside the fourth wall.
Chairs and a table may be used for the actors. REED, MIA, AMBER, CHAD should come
out just prior to show starting. REED will hand audition forms to AMBER, MIA, and CHAD
and they will begin filling them out.

REED. I just wanted to let you know, we’ll be getting started in a few minutes. I imagine
there will be a few more showing up. Did everyone fill out their audition forms?
MIA. What is that?
REED. What is what?
MIA. The form?
REED. Yes, “Audition Form”. Did everyone fill it out?
AMBER. Audition forms?
REED. Yes. Are you auditioning?
AMBER. Yes.
REED. And did you fill out one of these forms?
AMBER. Umm... I’m not sure. I filled out something. What does that one say?
REED. (sighs) It’s an audition form. It’s a form that asks for your name and what role you
would like to read for....
AMBER. I think I filled that one out. I remember writing my name down.
REED. (Like he is speaking to a child) Excellent. Then I’m sure you filled one of these
out.
AMBER. Do we need to put down our real names? I used my stage name. I’m using
Amber Frost now. I was Amber Groves.
REED. Any name is fine.

2

AMBER. Sometimes I’m Heather Groves, but I think I’m using Amber Frost. I like the
sound of that better.
MIA. I used Gilda May Golden for a week, but then I thought why convolute my identity
with a false label, you know?
AMBER. Uh-huh.
MIA. Why perpetuate a false identity in order to play some other false identity. Why
complicate your role in life? (to Reed) So, what roles are there?
CHAD. And what is this play? It said something about this being an original script.
Usually, we can get an advanced copy.
REED. Well, that’s the thing. How can I put this? We don’t quite have all of the uh...
MIA. The script? You don’t have all of the script?
REED. (As if caught) No, copies. We don’t have all the copies of the play for everyone
to... look at before the audition.
AMBER. You don’t have enough copies for anyone to look at before the auditions? How
am I going to prepare? How am I going to know what the show is about? Why don’t you
have enough?
REED. That will be explained in a few moments when we start. Besides the director
prefers the traditional “cold” readings.
CHAD. Really? Hmm. Here’s a question for you, who’s directing this play?
REED. She’s uh... (looking around)
DIRECTOR. (standing up in back) I am.
AMBER. It’s Vivian Vinderlou! Oh Miss Vinderlou!
CHAD. Who?
AMBER. Vinderlou. It’s me! Amber!
VINDERLOU. Who?
MIA. Amber.

3

AMBER. Amber Frost. I was in “Lunch at La Mancha” last year, remember? Actually, I
was Heather Hart then. I played Prison Peasant girl number 3.
VINDERLOU. La Mancha? Did I direct that?
MIA. I auditioned for that.
CHAD. That’s where I know you from! I read for Village Idiot number 2.
AMBER. May I just say you are a wonderful director miss Vinderlou. I learned so much. I
really grew as an actress. Even though it was a small part, and I had no lines, and was
on stage for 30 seconds. I would absolutely love to work with you again in this play. And
maybe have a bigger part. Maybe some lines. And you know... some more stage time.
(ALAN enters dressed in a food delivery uniform – gets form and sits to fill it out)
CHAD. What’s the name of this thing again?
REED. It’s called Death of a Disco Dancer.
AMBER. So, it’s a musical? I just loooove musicals. I did Phantom in high school and Le
Miz at the community center.
CHAD. I did Miz too. Did you ever do Seven Brides?
AMBER. No, but my sister did. She was a brother.
CHAD. Your sister was a brother?
AMBER. They didn’t have enough guys.
MIA. I thought this play was a mystery. It said something about a mystery in the paper.
AMBER. Maybe it’s a musical mystery. Like Drood.
CHAD. Speaking of Disco, have you ever seen “Fever”?
AMBER. No, I wanted to. Maybe next time a tour comes. Maybe it will...
VINDERLOU. (Interrupting) Maybe you all need to cut the chit-chit-chatter just a teensy
tad. Some of us had a rather late night and you sound like a bunch of bumble bees
buzzing around with all this... buzzy chit chatty chat.

4

REED. Yes, if you could just be seated until we’re ready to start.
VINDERLOU. Yes, do as he says. Auditions have a structure and stuff.
CHAD. Here’s a question for you. Since you’re the director, could you tell us what this
play is about? I think it would help the “structure” of the audition if we all knew a little
about it.
VINDERLOU. What the play is about? Are you kidding? I’m the director. I don’t explain
things. I just point to things. I say stuff like, “Pick up the pace.” “Learn your lines,” and
“LOUDER!” (holds temples) O.K. That was too loud. I need to sit. (Walks away)
REED. If you could all sit down somewhere until we call on you.
CHAD. I still don’t know what the play is about. What if there aren’t any male parts?
MIA. I’m sure there are male parts.
AMBER. Remember what they say, there are no small actors, only actors with small
male parts. Or something like that.
(TROY enters with TATANYA)
TROY. Is this the audition for the play?
MIA. (to someone near her) Oh no. It’s Troy May.
CHAD. I hate that guy! He gets every part he auditions for.
MIA. He’s in everything! Total snob.
TROY. I need to know how long this will take. I have a call back for an industrial film and
an audition for the “Scottish Play” at the REP.
CHAD. What’s the Scottish Play?
AMBER. Oh! That’s River Dance, isn’t it?
MIA. No, River Dance is the Irish Play.
ALAN. The Scottish play is one of Shakespeare’s plays. If you’re superstitious, you can
never mention the play by its real name.

5

AMBER. Why?
ALAN. The legend is, Shakespeare used actual “witches spells” in the dialogue. These
“spells” are actually “evil curses” that bring tragedy to everyone involved. Actors have
died on stage for no reason. Scenery falls over. Lights blow up. Ticket sales decline. The
evil curse can be summoned just by saying the title. So, if you’re an actor and say the
name of the play you’ll be cursed with bad luck. So, it’s safer to say, “the Scottish play.”
REED. (to TROY) We’ll be starting any minute now. It shouldn’t be too long.
CHAD. So what’s the name of the play you're not supposed to say? Or can't you say it?
ALAN. No, I’m not superstitious. But some actors and theater people are. They believe if
you say the real title or even quote a line by mistake, you need to go through a whole
ritual to remove the curse.
MIA. Oh. You’re talking about MACBETH!
TROY. WHO SAID THAT?!
CHAD. Said what?
TROY. Said Macbeth! Oh snap! I said it! Dang it!
(TROY walks to nearest doorway or exit and goes out. TATANYA follows him and waits
at door.)
CHAD. Where’s he going?
ALAN. (Covering above action) Ah. To remove the curse, he has to go back outside the
room where the “word” was spoken, turn around three times, chant a phrase and then
knock to be let back in the room.
(We hear TROY quickly uttering some type of sing-songy phrase three times and then he
knocks on the doorway.)
TATANYA. Come in. (TROY stomps back in.)
TROY. All right, look! Whoever said that... don’t say it again! I don’t have time for all this
nonsense.
REED. If you could just fill out the audition form.
TROY. Form?! I have to fill out a form? Don’t you know who I am? Tatanya! (snaps
fingers. TATANYA opens folder and hands TROY Papers. TROY hands over to REED)

6
TROY. (cont.) Here is my 5-page portfolio and 8 by 10. You’ll find more information if you
Google me.
REED. Well, this is very impressive. Very nice. (beat) But we still need you to fill out a
form.
TROY. Fine! Then, fine. (Snaps fingers at TATANYA – motions for her to get form) What
play is this anyway?
REED. It’s called “Death of a Disco Dancer”. (Hands Tatanya the form)
TROY. What kind of pathetic name is that? Who is it by?
REED. It’s a local, amateur playwright. He should be here soon.
(TATANYA hands TROY the form.)
TROY. Amateur? (sarcastically) Wonderful. It didn't say anything about that in the notice.
(looking at form) Had I known that... I would’ve.... Pen? I don’t have a pen! Would you
get me a pen!
TATANYA. Sorry. (Goes to get pen/pencil)
TROY. What theater group is this anyway?
REED. We’re the Adath Israel Players.
TROY. Who’s directing?
REED. I’ll be going through that in just a moment.
TROY. Who are you?
REED. I’m Reed Moore, I’m assisting the director.
TROY. Reed Moore? Sounds like a Public Service Announcement. By the by, I’m Troy
May. You may have seen some of my work. I’m big on the local circuit right now but I’m
starting to go ‘National’ and eventually... Regional!
REED. Terrific! I’m happy for you. Just fill out the form with all of that information.
TROY. My pen! (looking around for TATANYA)
TATANYA. Sorry. Here. (brings TROY a pen)

7

REED. (to TATANYA) Are you here to audition as well?
TATANYA. Me? No, I’m just here assisting Troy.
TROY. Excuse me! What is going on here? Are you trying to hook up with my lady? Right
in front of me?
REED. No, I was just wondering if she was here to audition. I wasn’t...
TROY. Please! That's the oldest pick-up line in the book! "Are you here to audition? Well
why don't you act like my girlfriend?" I've used it hundreds of times. Can't you be more
original than that? (Takes TATANYA by the arm to lead away) Come on April. (1)
TATANYA. It’s Tatanya.
TROY. Whoever.
(They cross away to sit and fill out form as MRS. NEEDLEMAN and JULIE enter)
MRS NEEDLEMAN. (as they are entering) Come on, it must be in here! Here we are, this
looks like it. Is this the audition? This must be the audition. Now go on up and tell them
you’re here. Make a good impression because you know, first impressions are always
the first thing they see. Now go on!
JULIE. Mom. Please. I can handle this.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Wait! Come here! You have a smudge or something on your
forehead. (takes out hankie – wets it by mouth)
JULIE. (rubs her head) It’s fine. It’s nothing.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. You don’t want to let them see you with a smudgy face. You need to
shine. You’re a little star! (Vigorously wipes Julie’s forehead with hankie)
JULIE. (pulls away) Would you stop?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. How’s your smile? Let me see your teeth. Did you brush?
JULIE. Yes.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Floss?
JULIE. Yes.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. White Strips?

8

JULIE. Yes.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. How’s your breath? Minty fresh?
JULIE. Yes, mother, it's fine. Everything is FINE!
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Remember what I told you, Remember your “S’s” - Shine. Sparkle.
Star. Shine-Sparkle-Star. Say it. Come on, say it for Momma.
JULIE. Shine, sparkle, star. (Crosses away)
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Go knock ‘em dead sweetie. And remember... project! And
enunciate!
REED. (to Julie) Here, just fill this out.
VINDERLOU. Let’s get it started in here. It feels like my head is being trampled by a flock
of wild yak.
REED. I think we need to explain a few things first.
VINDERLOU. Yes, the things. What things?
REED. About the show.
VINDERLOU. About the show. Of course, that’s right. Wasn’t there something about the
show? I remember something. Last night at the pre-production party. I don’t remember
much, but I remember something about the play. A problem.
REED. We weren’t going to talk about that just yet.
VINDERLOU. I don’t remember that. Did we talk about that?
REED. Let’s just get through the audition process and worry about remembering
everything later.
TROY. Are you going to be starting soon? Because as I stated, I have a tight schedule
today.
CHAD. That’s right. He has an audition for MACBETH.
TROY. (puts fingers in ears) AH! Darn it! Curse your mouth man! (stomps off and out
door)

9

AMBER. You’re supposed to say “River Dance”.
CHAD. My bad.
REED. Do I have everyone’s audition sheet?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Did you turn in your sheet Julie dear?
JULIE. Yes, mother. (she is still filling it out)
REED. I guess we’ll go ahead and begin. What we will do is...
MIA. Aren’t you going to tell us about the play first?
REED. The play? Right. O.K. Sure. Well, as I said, it’s called “Death of a Disco Dancer.”
It’s set in the 70’s. And let’s see... it’s a murder mystery, and...
AMBER. Is it a musical?
REED. Not as such. I mean, there’s a music element to it. There could be some dancing.
CHAD. Oh. Well, I’m not a strong dancer.
REED. That’s fine. It’s not pivotal to the show.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Not ‘pivotal’? What do you mean?
REED. Well, there are some shows where ‘dancing' would be important and/or ‘pivotal'.
A ballet for instance. Swan Lake or The Nutcracker. Dancing in those shows would be
pivotal. This is not one of those shows.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. So, there could be some “un-pivotal” dancing.
REED. Uh... (thinks) ...yes.
MIA. Have you read the play?
(TROY knocks on the door.)
REED. Of course. There are just a few things that aren’t set in stone. After all, it’s an
original work. Things may change as we go along. As we develop the work in rehearsal.
It may not be pivotal at this point but could pivot later.
TROY knocks on the door again with more force.

10

VINDERLOU. My head is pounding!
TATANYA. Oh! I forgot! (runs and opens door)
TROY. (enters) For crying out loud woman! Were you just going to leave me out there?!
I knew I shouldn’t have let you drive me here today. You’re about worthless!
TATANYA. Sorry.
TROY. Have we started yet?
TATANYA. They were just talking about...
TROY. I wasn’t talking to you. (then to Chad) And you! You better watch it! I take the
theatrical arts seriously. I know people in this town. One phone call from me and you
won’t work in community theatre again. You hear me?
VINDERLOU. Please enough of the dramatics. This is an audition!
REED. Yes. O.K. Can we have... (looking through forms from audience) x woman, x
man, and x either. Here is the script. We’ll start with this scene. It starts near the top with
“Gloria’s” line.
Woman from audience – you read Gloria; Man from audience, you read Francois.
Third person, you read Nick. Whenever you’re ready.
WOMAN as Gloria. (reading) “Isn’t this Disco charming?”
XX as Nick. (reading) Why yes Gloria. It is charming. Yet it seems rather murky and dark.
WOMAN as Gloria. (reading) You’re right Nick. It is rather murky and dark. And charming
at the same time. What do you think Francois?
MAN as Francois. Yes, Gloria! I think it is charming and yet dangerous! Perhaps it is the
danger that makes it so charming!
VINDERLOU. (Jumping up) Brilliant darlings. Round of applause everyone. (as they go
to their seats) Don’t call us, we’ll call you...
REED. Next, we’ll have Mia Moynihan and... Alan Stanton and...
(TROY clears his throat.)
REED. (cont....) Troy May.
TROY. It’s about time!

11

Mia, Alan and TROY come up front.
REED. (hands out script to each) Here is the script. Same scene. Troy, you read
Francois. Mia read Gloria and Alan you read Nick.
ALAN. O.K. So, I’m Nick, he’s Francois, and she’s Gloria.
TROY. No. I’m Francois. She’s Gloria and you’re Nick! Keep it straight.
MIA. Where are we starting?
REED. Page 5. Near the top with Gloria’s first line.
MIA. Who’s reading Francois?
TROY & ALAN. He is! (pointing to each other)
ALAN. No. You’re reading Francois.
TROY. That’s what I said.
VINDERLOU. It doesn’t matter. Somebody just read something!
MIA. But what is this scene? What happening in it? What is our relationship to each
other? What’s my motivation?
VINDERLOU. What does that matter darling? Plays are all the same. There is some kind
of conflict. You’re trying to “get something” or “go someplace” and “someone” or
“something” is preventing it. And at the end you overcome it. There. That’s what’s
happening in this scene. (Walks away and crosses to middle or back of room)
ALAN. You all ready?
TROY. Give me a moment!
(TROY stretches a bit, shakes it out. Closes his eyes with his fingers pressed to his
forehead. Hums a low note while he bounces up and down on his heals and then
suddenly jolts as if he’s been shocked)
TROY. All right. Ready.
MIA. O.K. (reading) “Isn’t this Disco charming?”
ALAN. (reading) Why yes Gloria. It is charming. Yet it seems rather murky and dark.

12
MIA. (reading) You’re right Nick. It is rather murky and dark. And charming at the same
time. What do you think Francois?
(A pause as they look to TROY to read his line. He is rolling his neck and stretching his
jaw.)
MIA. What do you think Francois? (pause) It’s your line.
TROY. What?
ALAN. Your line! You’re Francois.
TROY. I thought you were Francois.
ALAN & MIA. YOU’RE FRANCOIS!
TROY. FINE! I’ll read Francois then, shall I? (looks at the script) Where are you?
(Alan points to place for him.)
TROY. Give me the cue again.
MIA. What do you think Francois?
TROY. (reads with Shakespearian overdone proper British accent) Yes, Gloria! I think it
is charming and yet dangerous! Perhaps that is the appeal! The danger is what makes it
so charming!
VINDERLOU. Excuse me. Pardon me, darling. Why are you doing that?
TROY. Doing what?
VINDERLOU. That accent.
TROY. What accent? I wasn’t using an accent. I was acting.
MIA. Well, I don't think someone named "Francois" would "act" like he's British. It would
be more French or Montrealian.
TROY. It could be Basque.
VINDERLOU. Can we just continue? s'il vous plait!
ALAN. Sure. Let’s see... (reading) Yes Gloria, Francois is right. Danger has an appeal. I
wouldn’t be surprised if something dangerous happens tonight.

13
TROY. (with accent again) Of course! We all should be on the ‘lookout' here, as we are
disco dancing. Because we...
VINDERLOU. Cut! Thank you! Next.
TROY. But I wasn’t finished. There is still...
VINDERLOU. Cut! Thank you! Next. (snaps fingers at Reed)
MIA. How on Earth does that guy get every part he auditions for around here?
CHAD. Well, this is Lower Merion.
MIA. Point taken.
REED. Can we have Chad, Amber, and Julie, please.
(TROY, MIA and ALAN go sit; AMBER and CHAD take their places and scripts.)
TROY. (during above action) These people don’t know brilliant acting when they see it.
MIA. I’m sure they’ll know it - when then see it.
TROY. Was that an insult?
MIA. Why no, I’m sure you’d know an insult when you hear one.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Julie honey? Do a wonderful job!
TROY. How embarrassing. Bringing your mother to auditions.
TATANYA. Troy honey, you did a wonderful job!
MIA. Completely embarrassing.
JULIE. I’m not ready quite yet.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. What’s that, honey?
JULIE. I said I'm not ready. I haven't finished filling out the form.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. But the man called you, honey. You need to do as they say.
JULIE. I don’t want to read yet. I’m not ready to read yet.

14
REED. O.K. Well, let’s see. We need another female to read for this scene. I suppose we
could...
VINDERLOU. What about that girl? (indicating Tatanya)
REED. Not a good idea. She’s not here to audition. She’s just here...assisting.
VINDERLOU. We need somebody darling, ask her.
REED. I did ask her, and the person she’s here assisting had a major hissy fit.
VINDERLOU. And you’re here assisting me darling, and I insist that you assist me by
asking her again.
REED. But...
VINDERLOU. (Snaps fingers and points)
REED. Excuse me? T----? Uh, could... is it possible that... Would you mind helping us
out by reading one of the parts until Julie is ready?
TATANYA. It’s Tatanya – and sure! I’d love too! (2)
TROY. Wait! What are you doing?
TATANYA. I’m just helping them out.
TROY. Oh, you think so? Well, see here my good lady, I’m the one that came to audition,
not you. (REED exchanges a look with VINDERLOU.) You couldn’t act your way out of a
paper bag. Here’s you, and here’s a paper bag. “Oh, help me! Help! I’m in a paper bag! If
I could only act!
TATANYA. But I just...
TROY. Fine! Go ahead! See if I care! If you want to make a fool of yourself and get
trapped in a bag, be my guest.
CHAD. Why not, you did.
TROY. What?!
MIA. I’m not sure, but that may have been the insult you were waiting for.

15
VINDERLOU. Let’s go people! Let’s move the ‘drama’ from life and put it up there on the
stage. Please.
(Tatanya goes up and takes place with script.)
REED. O.K. Turn to page 18. In the middle of the page, there’s a scene with FRANCOIS,
GLORIA, and ROXIE. Chad, read Francois. Amber read Gloria, and Tatanya read Roxie.
Start with Gloria’s line where she says, “Who’s your friend?” You got it?
CHAD. Yea. I got it.
AMBER. Got it.
VINDERLOU. All right. Start when you’re ready.
AMBER. (reading) Who’s your friend?
CHAD. (reading almost silently) This is my new dance partner Roxie. She’s the hottest
dancer this side of...
VINDERLOU. (interrupts) O.K. One moment. Mr. Francois reading person? I’m having a
little trouble hearing you.
CHAD. Sorry. Should I try it again?
VINDERLOU. Yes, please. And if you could make it somewhere near audible, I’m sure it
would be a glorious thing.
CHAD. (reading, slightly louder but still inaudible) This is my new dance partner Roxie.
She’s the hottest dancer this side of... (looks out to Vinderlou) Is that better?
VINDERLOU. Perhaps for the National Lip-Reading Theater but who cares. Just keep
going. Skip to the next line.
AMBER. O.K. (traces finger through script) Here it is. (reads) “Roxie Van Rocks? She’s
your new dance partner? Why Francois! Don’t you know about her?”
TATANYA. (reading with menacing intensity) “Oh yeah? What do you know about me?”
(gets in Amber’s face) “So, he wants to be my dance partner. What are you going to do
about it, Chickee?”
(Bumps Amber back with a slight body check–Amber not expecting this almost falls.)

16
TATANYA. (cont. Reading) “Francois knows how to dance with a girl.” (goes to Chad –
puts arms around him) “I can tell he hasn’t danced with many girls. Many girls that were
‘good’. But I can show him things, ‘moves’ he has never dreamed about.” (she forcefully
pulls Chad to her – he drops his script) “Let’s show her how we can dance, baby. Show
her how we do it.”
CHAD. (a little flustered) Um... is it... my line? (wants to reach to pick up script but wants
to remain just as he is)
AMBER. (reading) “Francois! I can’t believe you want to dance with her!”
Chad let’s forth a nervous high-pitched forced sound.
AMBER. (reading) “Get your fickle fingers off Francois!” (grabs Tatanya’s arms and pulls
her forcefully from Chad.) “He’s my partner!”
Chad let’s forth another nervous high-pitched forced sound.
TATANYA. (reading) “Over your dead body!”
AMBER. (reading) Oh yeah? “Bring it on!”
(Tatanya rushes Amber and grabs her in a headlock. They almost seem to be actually
fighting and struggling.)
VINDERLOU. (to Reed) O.K. Help me out here darling, is this real or is this a scene?
REED. This is the scene. (to actors) And cut! Very good, thank you.
(Tatanya and Amber separate very peacefully and pleasant. Chad, a little rattled,
straightens his clothes and hair. Picks up his script.)
CHAD. Here’s a question for you; Could we maybe try that one more time? I think I can
be a little louder.
REED. Perhaps later. We need to get everyone through at least one time.
TROY. That was pathetic.
MIA. Why? Because nobody had an accent?
REED. Are you ready Julie?
JULIE. Yes.

17

MRS NEEDLEMAN. (addressing REED) Excuse me? Excuse me? Sir?
TROY. (to TATANYA) Excuse me, but who told you, you could go up there and do that?
TATANYA. What?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Excuse me, but what part do you want my Julie to read? I would
prefer she not read the trampy part.
TROY. You’re not even auditioning.
TATANYA. I know. I was just helping. It was fun.
TROY. Fun? Acting isn’t fun! There’s no having fun in theatre! You were pathetic up
there!
MRS NEEDLEMAN. If I could just request she read a nicer part? If that’s possible?
JULIE. Mother. Please don’t.
MIA. (to TROY) Why don’t you leave her alone?
JULIE. I want to read for the part T----- just read if you don’t mind. (3)
TATANYA. It’s Tatanya.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. But I do mind.
TROY. (to Mia) Why don’t you mind your own business you but-inksi!
MIA. Why don’t you get a clue, dork-meister?
JULIE. Mother! You promised you wouldn’t do this.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. I know but you should ...
JULIE. Mother. You said you would wait outside. Please wait outside then.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. But I...
JULIE. Mother. Outside! Now!
(NEEDLEMAN crosses dejected and exits.)
VINDERLOU. (to Reed) Now, is this one of the scenes?

18

REED. No, this is real.
VINDERLOU. Pity.
REED. O.K. Let’s move along. For the next reading, if we could have... let’s see... (looks
through papers)
TROY. Look, I’m done with this dog and pony audition. (to Tatanya) Go get the car.
TATANYA. But I...
TROY. Just do what I say. (and then to REED) Pardon me, but I can spare about 2 more
minutes, so you better have me read something Reed. (beat) Ha. That was funny. “Read
something Reed”. Funny. Wasn’t it?
ALAN. Such cutting repartee.
TROY. What ‘Burger Boy’?
REED. (to Group) Can we have a little order please?
TROY. Sure. I’ll have a Double Cheeseburger and large order of fries. Did you get that
Burger boy? (laughs at his bit) I kill me!
CHAD. Someone ought to.
AMBER. Really.
ALAN: (Mumbling) It’s Burger MAN
TROY. What? (to TATANYA) I told you to go get the car!
MIA. Why don’t you pick on someone your own sex?
REED. Can we have Julie, Mia, Alan, and... we need one more male.
(TROY clears throat.)
REED. Hmmm. Who could we get?
(TROY clears throat louder.)
REED. One more male actor is what we need.
(TROY clears throat LOUDER)

19

REED. Let’s see, how about... Troy.
MIA. I’m not reading with that cretin. Forget it. I’ve got to get some air. Come on T----. (4)
TATANYA. It’s Tatanya. (they cross and exit)
REED. (noticing them exiting) All right, how about... Amber?
AMBER. Sure!
(As Troy and Amber go to stage)
TROY. Amber? What a lovely name, for a lovely girl.
AMBER. Thank you.
TROY. So, tell me, do you have a car?
AMBER. Yes.
TROY. Did you drive here?
AMBER. Uh-huh.
TROY. Don’t I know you from somewhere?
AMBER. I was in the chorus of Kismet.
TROY. Of course. The Kismet Chorus.
REED. On page 25 in your scripts. Julie read Roxie. Troy - Francois. Allen read
Youngman and Amber read Gloria again if you would. Start at the top of 25.
TROY. Excuse me? I would like to read for Francois this time.
REED. That would be fine. Whenever everyone is ready, go ahead and start.
(TROY begins his little pre-reading ritual again but the actors start.)
AMBER. (reading) Roxie! You will never beat me in the dance competition! I have found
another partner. The greatest dancer in all the disco!
ROXIE. And who would that be? Who is greater than Francois Derriere?
AMBER. (reading) Yo-Yo Youngman! And here he is now! (gestures to Allen)

20

ALLEN. (starts to read) Yes!
TROY. (reading and interrupting) Yes! I am Yo-Yo Young, man! The greatest...
(JULIE, AMBER, and ALLEN all ad-lib to stop him. “Wait, wrong part etc.")
TROY. Why do you people insist on interrupting the magic?
ALAN. You’re supposed to read the part of Francois.
TROY. And? Your point? Look, I told you I only have a couple of minutes left. Do you
want me to read, Reed, or not!
CHAD. Yea really. He’s got that other audition to go to. (beat) For MACBETH!
(TROY throws script down and stomps off and out the door.)
CHAD. (at above action) Oops. I did it again.
AMBER. Jeez. I’m glad that I’m not superstitious. Knock on wood.
CHAD. Here’s a question for you, why don’t I read his part until he gets back then?
VINDERLOU. Fine! Just somebody read something!! I have to go take several more
aspirin darling. Take charge while I’m gone. (exits out the back)
CHAD. (goes up and picks up script) What page are we on?
ALAN. (showing) Here. Page 25.
CHAD. Right. Hurry before he gets back.
ALAN. (reading) “Yes! I am Yo Yo Youngman. And I am the greatest dancer of the
disco.”
AMBER. (reading) “You see? Wait, Francois! What are you doing? No! Put that gun
away!
(CHAD reacting, reaches in pocket and pulls out a comb holding as if it were a gun.)
ALAN. (reading) “Ha! You are a jealous man I see!”
JULIE. (reading) "Why don't you settle this like real men? On the dance floor! Whoever
can out-hustle the other, the winner shall be my partner. And I will dance with them."
ALAN. (reading) Yes, I shall out-hustle this Francois!

21

CHAD. (reading) Oh yeah? (points comb at Alan)
AMBER. (reading) No! Francois don’t!
(We hear two gunshots off stage. Amber screams. ALAN holds his chest more or less as
a reaction to the sounds. CHAD looking dumbfounded looks at his comb.)
CHAD. What the...?
AMBER. Oh heavens! What was that?
CHAD. That wasn’t me. (holds up comb)
ALAN. It sounded like it came from out there! Must be a car that backfired.
JULIE. I thought it sounded like it came from back there. (points to back of room)
CHAD. (looking at comb) I don’t think it came from here.
VINDERLOU. (Entering from back – holding ears) That was far too loud! Someone is
setting off fireworks. Is it July already?
REED. We thought those were gunshots!
VINDERLOU. I know. Everything sounds like gunshots right now.
(Doors opens and Troy comes in rather off balance. He moves around almost as if he is
doing one of his acting warm-ups. It seems as if he is trying to say something.
Breathing rather heavy and wild-eyed. He then goes back out through doors.)
VINDERLOU. What a dreadful entrance! Have him come back and try that again.
REED. I’m not so sure that was an entrance. I’m not sure what that was.
CHAD. I thought he was supposed to knock. Isn’t that how the curse thing goes?
ALAN. Yes, it is.
(Doors open again. JIM the playwright enters with several notebooks and a clump of
papers in his arms. Several pages drop as he moves around.)
JIM. Sorry, I'm late. I got the extra copies and the rest of the thing. Sorry, am I
interrupting?
REED. Uh no. We were more or less at a stopping point.

22

JIM. (as he crosses toward Reed) How’s it going?
REED. Fine. Good. Everyone, this is Jim Cutler, the playwright.
JIM. How's it going, everybody?
Cast responds accordingly.
JIM. Hey, who’s the guy laying out in the hall?
REED. Laying in the hall?
JIM. Yea. Right outside the doors there. There’s some guy laying there... or is it “lying”
there? I think it’s lying there. That’s right, “things lay, people lie.” Anyway, he’s right
outside. Almost looks like he’s dead. You know, just an FYI.
AMBER. Dead? Oh my. Oh no! Do you think it could be...?
(ALAN and AMBER rush off and out the doors to check.)
JIM. Here are a few more copies of the script. I’m still a little fuzzy on the ending and I’m
not too hip on the whole disco thing anymore. I’m thinking the setting should be a Rave.
Like a “Tales from beyond the Rave” or how about “I Spit on Your Rave”. But if you guys
are married to the disco thing, that’s cool, maybe the Rave thing can be a different show.
VINDERLOU. (calmly) Did you say there’s someone dead out there darling?
JIM. Speaking of which, I met this Inspector lady from the department of something or
other. I thought she might be a great help with the technical aspect of the mystery. She
should be here anytime. (looks at arm as if checking watch) Where’s my watch? Wait I
don’t have a watch.
CHAD. Here’s a question. Should we keep reading or what?
(Doors fling open and Amber enters dramatically.)
AMBER. I can’t believe... he was just... and then he... (covers face as if to sob)
ALAN enters follow by INSPECTOR BRAVURA
JIM. Ah! There she is! Inspector... what was it again?
INSPECTOR. Bravura. Bonnie Bravura.
JIM. Right. I thought it would be cool to have a real inspector to help out. You know, what
would a real inspector do if someone were murdered?

23

MRS NEEDLEMAN. (entering) The poor man is dead!
AMBER. (enters) Someone killed him!!
JIM. Yeah, if one of the characters said something like that, and then the inspector would
say something like...
INSPECTOR. If everyone could please stay clear of the body. Everyone, please back up.
JIM. Yes, just like that! That would be great. I should be writing this down.
INSPECTOR. If everyone could please step into the room.
REED. I think this is real.
JIM. I know, right? That’s what I’m going for.
REED. No, I mean real real. Here and now. The guy you saw laying out there in the hall?
I think he’s dead.
JIM. Right. That would make sense because I didn't write that.
VINDERLOU. Dead? Someone’s dead?
INSPECTOR. Is everyone accounted for?
MRS. NEEDLEMAN. Where’s my Julie? Julie!
JULIE. I’m right here mother.
ALAN. There are two others. I’m not sure where they are.
AMBER. Do you think one of them killed him?
INSPECTOR. Now, no one said anything about anyone being “killed”.
AMBER. But he’s dead!
INSPECTOR. Yes, this is true, but a lot of people die without being killed. Does anyone
know his identity?
ALAN. Troy.
AMBER. Troy May. A famous local actor.

24

MRS. NEEDLEMAN. Julie honey, get your things. We’re leaving at once!
INSPECTOR. I’m afraid I must ask you to stay until we get all of the facts here.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. But you said he wasn’t killed. If he wasn’t killed, why do we have to
stay? I for one don’t want my precious little girl exposed to this type of thing. Suppose he
died of some unknown airborne disease? (to Julie) Julie go wash your face at once!
JIM. This is good stuff. So reactionary and natural.
INSPECTOR. Mrs...?
NEEDLEMAN. Needleman. Marjorie Needleman. Marjorie with a J.
INSPECTOR. Mrs. Needleman, I need to handle things in a certain manner, O.K.?
Now, this may or may not be a homicide, but I need to take certain precautions, you
understand. So, just humor me and play along. I must ask you and your daughter to
remain here until I know what’s going on.

NEEDLEMAN. Fine. (digs in purse –crossing to Julie) Here Julie, I have some anti-
bacterial lotion, let me see your hands.

JULIE. Mother!
AMBER. Shouldn’t we do something? Call somebody?
CHAD. (indicating the inspector) She is somebody.
AMBER. No, I mean, like an ambulance?
CHAD. Why would you call an ambulance? He’s dead. If he was injured then yeah, I
would say call an ambulance.
INSPECTOR. I need to see everyone, get some questions answered.
JIM. Perfect. That’s exactly how I would write it. (to REED) Seeing everyone and the
whole question business. That’s good.
REED. Sure. Where should we do this? The seeing and question thing?
JIM. Well, I would say the drawing-room or the library at this point, but I don't think this
place has those facilities. So, I'm open for suggestions.
REED. Uh.. how about here? Namely, because we have this room booked.

25
JIM. Perfect! There wouldn't have to be a set change and a blackout. It can stay linear.
REED. I have no idea what you just said.
JIM. Hey, Bonnie, we’re going go ahead and use this space to have the interrogation
scene. So, if everyone is here...
ALAN. What about Mia and T------? (5)
JIM. It’s Tatanya.
CHAD. Here’s another question for you, do I have time to go to the bathroom?
MRS. NEEDLEMAN. We’re going to need to call your father and tell him we’re going to
be late. You know how he worries.
INSPECTOR. All right. It looks like we need to track down a few people so, why doesn’t
everybody do what they need to do, and we’ll gather back in here in 15-20 mins?
JIM. Yea. This would be a great spot to stick the intermission. During the real show, we
can have them serve xxxxx
VINDERLOU. Coffee? Did you say coffee? I would kill for a cup of coffee!
REED. All right then. Everybody take (15-20) minutes. Go to the bathroom. Make your
calls. Get your coffee.
INSPECTOR. Jim, could I see you and your friends for a minute?
JIM. Sure. (to REED) See that’s a great exit line right there. Because now we can exit
with true motivation. I'm going to have to remember that.
ALL exit for END OF ACT ONE

26

ACT 2
(AMBER enters with ALAN in conversation as they cross toward stage area.)
AMBER. This whole thing is awful. Really horrible! It’s just so horribly awful. We were in
Kismet together. I was in the chorus. I sure he remembered me. He even asked if I had a
car. I think he was going to ask me to drive him somewhere.
ALAN. Be his chauffeur.
AMBER. I guess if what’s her name wasn’t going to drive him, but now, neither one of us
will. Because he’s... I can’t believe it.
Do you think it was that Shakespeare curse you were telling us about?
ALAN. Elizabethan plays can’t kill you. They can traumatize you, but that’s about it.
AMBER. Well, I am definitely traumatized! What do you think happened?
ALAN. I heard that the medical examiner believes the cause of death was anaphylactic
shock.
AMBER. Anna who?
ALAN. Anaphylaxis. Allow me to explain...
(Conversation fades just as MIA, TATANYA and CHAD enter)
MIA. (enters) An Allergy?!
TATANYA. Yes. Troy was deathly allergic to all kinds of things. Fish, shellfish, bee
stings, and peanuts.
CHAD. You think a fish killed him?
TATANYA. I don’t know how it’s possible! He was very careful about everything he ate.
He wouldn’t eat anything at all today.
MIA. Are you sure?
(Enter MRS NEEDLEMAN, REED, JIM, and INSPECTOR)

27
MRS NEEDLEMAN. (talking as she enters) I’m sure! I’m absolutely sure he didn’t eat
one! I said to him, "Young man, would you like a cookie?" I always bring them as a treat
for Julie and I have extras on hand. And he says, "No Ma'am, I don't want a ‘stupid'
cookie." Ma’am? What am I, a hundred? And "stupid cookie"? I mean, that was uncalled
for in my opinion.
INSPECTOR. What kind of cookies were they?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Oatmeal and raisin. Homemade. I make them from scratch from my
mother’s secret recipe. She used to...
INSPECTOR. (interrupting) Uh-huh. But you didn’t see him eat anything? Touch
anything?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. No. Uh-uh. I just saw the young man come storming out through the
doors muttering and stomping around like a spoiled little kid. He seemed very upset.
That’s why I thought he’d enjoy a nice cookie, so I asked him...
INSPECTOR. (interrupting) Yes, you said he refused your offer; and then?
MRS. NEEDLEMAN. Well, then he proceeded to do this funny little dance where he spun
around a few times.
INSPECTOR. Funny dance did you say? Spun around?
REED. I might be able to shed some light on that. Apparently, Troy was one of your more
superstitious actors. You see, some actors have this aversion to anyone saying the name
of one of Shakespeare’s plays...
JIM. Right! Macbeth! That is so weird!
INSPECTOR. Macbeth? What’s the deal with Macbeth?
REED. There’s supposed to be this “curse.” If someone says the name, you have to go
through a ritual.
INSPECTOR. You’re kidding. A ritual that involves a funny dance and spinning around?
JIM. Oh yeah. You have to do that whole deal outside and then knock on the door to be
let back in.

28

INSPECTOR. Are you telling me that Troy was in the process of this ritual?
REED. It was his third time out there
INSPECTOR. Third time? The other actors knew he had this superstition and facilitated
the “hat trick” as it were.
REED. Well, yes. I mean, Troy wasn’t the most pleasant person to be around.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. I should say not. Stupid cookie.
INSPECTOR. And which of the actors knew about Troy’s superstition and proceeded to
take advantage of it?
REED. That would be Chad.
INSPECTOR. (noting in pad) Chad?
CHAD. Yes? Hi, how are you?
INSPECTOR. I understand you let the name of a certain play slip out a few times. And in
doing so, caused Troy to have to leave the room.
CHAD. Well, I uh... that’s is...
INSPECTOR. I understand that he wasn’t very popular among most of you.
MIA. He was depriving a village somewhere of an idiot.
AMBER. Please, Mia, not everyone felt that way and you know it. Stop being spiteful.
INSPECTOR. And you are...?
AMBER. Heather Groves. No, I mean Amber Groves. No, Heather Fr... Amber. Amber
Frost.
INSPECTOR. (noting in pad) Are you sure?
AMBER. Yes, I’m sure and I’m also sure that T-----, (indicates Tatanya) doesn’t
appreciate people saying awful things about her boyfriend who’s lying dead out there.

29

TATANYA. It’s Tatanya!
MIA. Boyfriend? That’s rich. More like fascist dictator and indentured servant than the
proverbial “boyfriend – girlfriend.”
TATANYA. I do feel bad that this happened. But honestly, we weren’t what I would call
dating. At least not to him.
MIA. No, you were just driving Mr. Troy to the Piggly Wiggly.
INSPECTOR. (To Mia) And your name is Mia? (noting) Is that right?
MIA. Yes, that's right. Mia. (beat) Mea Culpa.
INSPECTOR. Funny.
MIA. Thank you.
JIM. Can I use that?
CHAD. Here’s a question. Are we being accused or something?
INSPECTOR. No one has “accused” anyone of anything. I’m just trying to get all the facts
surrounding the event.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Yes, why don't all of you children behave yourselves and not give
the nice lady any more backtalk? Go ahead, dear.
INSPECTOR. Thank you. Chad, you said “Macbeth” several times that caused Troy to
leave the room, right?
CHAD. That’s right.
INSPECTOR. And you knew he was superstitious about that?
CHAD. I didn't know about it until Alan told us about it.
INSPECTOR. Alan?

30

ALAN. Only because Troy mentioned he had an audition for what he termed the “Scottish
Play.” A lot of theater people may not be familiar with the legend surrounding. I merely
explained it.
AMBER. How did you know about it?
ALAN. I was a theater major in college.
MIA. That explains the delivery uniform.
INSPECTOR. Prior to Alan informing everyone about this, no one knew anything about
it?
AMBER. I didn’t know.
JIM. Bonnie? I did know about it.
INSPECTOR. But you weren’t here Jim.
JIM. Oh, right.
INSPECTOR. Did any of you know Troy before today?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Amber was in a show with him.
AMBER. Last summer. It was Kismet.
INSPECTOR. You think it was fate?
AMBER. I’m sorry?
REED. Inspector? Kismet was the name of the show where she first met Troy. Not the
fate Kismet.
INSPECTOR. Oh, the show. Of course. Anyone else meet Troy?
CHAD. I’ve seen him at auditions. All the auditions. But I didn’t know him. I mean, I knew
him, from seeing him at auditions. But I didn’t know him, know him. You know? Mia,
didn’t you know him?

31

MIA. Everyone in theater around here is familiar with Troy. But Troy isn’t familiar with
anyone around here in theater, and it doesn’t mean I knew him.
INSPECTOR. Anyone else?
JULIE. (raising her hand)
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Oh, Miss Inspector? My Julie has something!
INSPECTOR. Yes?
JULIE. Alan, didn’t you do a show with him?
ALAN. Two years ago. How did you know about that?
INSPECTOR. (making note) Two years ago? So you knew him?
ALAN. I didn't get a chance. A few weeks into rehearsals he became mysteriously ill and
had to drop out.
INSPECTOR. Mysteriously ill?
ALAN. Maybe he ate one of her cookies.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. How dare you!
VIVIAN. Julie, darling, didn’t I see you in a musical revue last fall...
MRS NEEDLEMAN. The Sondheim Sonatas! She was terrific! She had three solos. See
how everyone remembers you?
JULIE. MOTHER! (beat) I’m not sure if Troy was part of the cast...
MRS NEEDLEMAN. I don’t remember him in that show! Unless he was the one in the
Whirling Dervish costume.
JULIE. MOTHER, please! (beat) He was in the cast. But about a week into the
rehearsals, he was replaced.
INSPECTOR. He became suddenly ill?

32

JULIE. No. He kept singing with a bad accent.
INSPECTOR. Oh. So, you never really knew him either.
JULIE. No. But when I saw him here today at the auditions, I thought I recognized him
from somewhere. And then when I heard his voice...(stops)
INSPECTOR. (waits) ...and when you heard his voice?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Answer the nice lady, Julie.
JULIE. Nothing. Just I recognized his voice.
INSPECTOR. And that’s it?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. For God’s sake, leave her alone!
INSPECTOR. So, everyone more or less knew Troy. Some of you were in other
productions or auditions, but outside of T---- here, none of you knew him personally?
TATANYA. It’s Tatanya!
JIM. (to REED) I like the way she did that. Just sums it up with a few sentences. You
don’t need a two-page monologue to do that. Most writers do it just for the sake of
repetition, you know, in case the audience wasn’t paying attention.
REED. I’m sorry, what did you say?
JIM. Exactly. Now here’s where I’d establish opportunity.
INSPECTOR. All right, when Troy went out of the room, where was everyone?
JIM. See!? I called it!
CHAD. I was in here. I took over reading when he left. And so were Alan and Julie and
Amber, Mr. Reed and Miss Vinderlou.
JIM. Where is Vinderlou?
REED. She needed something for her stomach. She said she’d be right back.

33

INSPECTOR. And the rest of you were out of the room?
MIA. Tatanya and I were outside in the parking lot, where we saw you and Jim drive up in
separate cars. Then he walked over and got into your car.
INSPECTOR. O.K. So, you saw Jim and me - but the question is, did you see Troy?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. He didn’t go outside. I saw him as I told you. He just came out there
in the lobby.
INSPECTOR. Right. After Chad said "Macbeth,” he left to remove the so-called curse. He
has to go out of the room and... what is it?
ALAN. Turn around three times and knock to be let in.
(There are three knocks on the door – everyone looks at each other somewhat
perplexed)
AMBER. Oh! Maybe Troy’s all right now!
MIA. Ye of little intelligence.
(REED opens the door and VINDERLOU enters. She has a fast-food bag and a soda.
She is munching on a sandwich.)
VINDERLOU. Bless you, darling, my hands were full. Have I missed anything?
REED. Well, it seems Troy had some type of allergic reaction.
VINDERLOU. The poor dear. Does anybody want some? (holds up sandwich) I bought
two.
CHAD. What is it?
VINDERLOU. The Kipper Hoagie. On gluten-free bread.
INSPECTOR. Is that fish? How long have you had that sandwich?
VINDERLOU. About 15 or 20 minutes. The line was unbearable at Hymie’s or else I
would have been back sooner. Why?

34
JIM. No, see that doesn't work. Yes, she has ‘fish' and ‘fish' may have been the murder
weapon, but it’s hard to be sneaky with a hoagie. I see where you’re going with that,
Bonnie, but speaking as a playwright, you would have introduced the element to the
person in some unique, subtle way.
VINDERLOU. I've missed quite a lot, haven't I?
INSPECTOR. Jim, this isn’t one of your murder mysteries. This is real life. It’s not going
to wrap up neatly with a happy ending. If this is a murder, and again I say “if,” it could be
under investigation for months, maybe years.
VINDERLOU. Darlings, I don’t have months or years to spend on this, I have pedicure
scheduled tomorrow.
JIM. It won't take months or years! Look, Bonnie, you've already established a lot of the
groundwork. I couldn't have written it better. (beat) Well, maybe a few things I would’ve
changed like the one bit where ... but that’s not the point. Now we need to open it up and
really explore it. Get interactive!
VINDERLOU. Oh, no. I can’t stand it when you break the fourth wall. It takes the illusion
right out of it.
INSPECTOR. What are you talking about?
VINDERLOU. He’s talking about how he ruins the fantasy of theater by inviting the
audience all up in it.
JIM. What happens is this... imagine if you will that we’re into the second act of the play
and all this stuff has happened. The guy has died. Was he killed? Was it an accident? If it
wasn’t an accident, then who killed him? Who had it in for him? Who had the chance and
took it? And how did they do it? And then imagine this entire room filled with an audience
watching the play. (lights up on audience)
AMBER. Yes. I can almost see it.
JIM. We give the audience the opportunity to question the characters. The characters,
who are actually the actors. And the actors respond as the characters who are now
suspects.
INSPECTOR. How do they do that?

35
JIM. They have to improvise. Just play along everyone. Imagine that you’re in this show,
there is an audience here, and you all have to respond to questions. O.K.? Let’s try it.
ED. Does anyone in the audience have any questions they would like to ask the
suspects?
ED and BEV lead Q&A.
ED. All right, we have time for one more question. (will take one more question)
(Play resumes)
INSPECTOR. Yes, that was educational, but that really doesn’t do anything to build a
case.
VINDERLOU. See darling, I told you it’s a waste of time. It’s just a cheap ploy to involve
the audience and terrorize the actors.
JIM. But it brings undiscovered ideas to the forefront. Things I didn’t even think about
when I was writing the play.
INSPECTOR. But there is no play. And no real case.
MIA. I came to that conclusion hours ago.
CHAD. Here’s a question. What happens in the play?
VINDERLOU. What play, darling?
AMBER. The one we were auditioning for. The Death of the Disco thing? I mean, who
gets killed in that and who does it?
VINDERLOU. Oh. I just remembered! That was the problem with the show we were
talking about at the pre-production party last night. The play. It’s not finished. (to JIM)
You haven’t finished the play!
REED. Vivian. We weren’t going to...
JIM. Actually, it’s almost finished. Maybe not on paper. But I have a few good ideas in my
head. I’m just not sure about a few things. Minor details. Like the ending, who did it, and
why.

36

CHAD. Wait, what you’re saying is, you don’t even know who did it in your own play?
JIM. That’s the main reason I invited Bonnie here today.
INSPECTOR. But Jim, this isn’t a murder mystery here.
JIM. It could be. It was clear no one liked this guy. And he winds up dead, and it
“appears” he had an allergic reaction.
AMBER. Yes. Prophylactic shock.
JIM. Right. What a perfect crime! Make it look like an accident.
AMBER. He’s right! I think someone did it.
MIA. Who?
AMBER. It’s always the quiet ones, like... Alan or Julie.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. My Julie wouldn’t hurt a fly.
MIA. Julie and Alan were in here.
AMBER. But you were outside.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. And Tatanya was outside!
MIA. And what? We force-fed him a peanut butter sandwich?
ALAN. Actually, there are documented cases of anaphylactic shock where the victim only
came in contact with a substance. Such as fish oil residue on a spoon they touched. Or
airborne peanut dust from discarded shells.
AMBER. And how do you know that?
ALAN. Working in the food services industry we had to take certification classes on food
allergens.
AMBER. You mean someone could have been eating peanuts and the dust killed Troy?
Oh my Gosh! What a horrible way to die! Peanut dust!
MIA. (to Tatanya) Were you eating peanuts on the way to the audition?

37
TATANYA. No! Troy was very aware of those kinds of things. I had to take several
detours driving him over here. I couldn’t drive down any street that had a seafood
restaurant.
AMBER. But Ms. Vinderlou had a fish sandwich!!
INSPECTOR. Which she got after the fact. I don’t think someone can die from a
subsequent event.
AMBER. So how could he have died from an allergic thing if no one had a thing he was
allergic too?
JIM. You know what? She’s right. Try as we might. This just isn’t working.
INSPECTOR. What isn’t working?
JIM. This plotline. It's far too complex. I couldn't even write something like this.
INSPECTOR. But you’re not writing this one.
JIM. I know. If I were, I would have the guy shot or stabbed. What can you do with
allergies? No. Crumple this one up and throw it in the trash.
(During the following dialogue JIM casually makes his way over to TATANYA and they
subtlety whisper to each other. It should not draw focus)
INSPECTOR. No, wait. I didn't see it before until now. Here's a person who's overly
cautious about his condition. He goes as far as making someone avoid driving by certain
restaurants. And yet, somehow, the element was introduced to him. It had to be. If that's
the case, it is a homicide. It was nothing out in the open, no one was eating anything
except for the cookies Mrs. Needleman had and...
MRS NEEDLEMAN. And he said, “I don’t want any of your stupid cookies!” Just like that.
“Stupid cookies.”
INSPECTOR. He didn’t eat anything, and no one could’ve made him eat anything. No, he
was far too cautious. That could explain the illness in the other shows you mentioned. A
harmless snack could’ve been cooked in peanut oil. I’m sure he learned his lesson.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. He could’ve learned a lesson in manners. A simple “No thank you”
would’ve been nice. God rest his soul.
INSPECTOR. He didn’t ingest it. He must have come in contact with it.

38

REED. It was something he touched?
MIA. Well, he touched me with his warm and caring nature. That made me feel slightly ill.
AMBER. The script! Oh my gosh, he touched the script!
CHAD. He had a pen too!
REED. I believe Tatanya gave him the pen.
INSPECTOR. A pen?
(The attention turns to TATANYA. Who we will now see talking to JIM. She immediately
realizes the focus is on her and tries to recover.)
TANTANYA. Pen? I’m sorry, does someone need a pen? (She looks around as if to find
one)
JIM. Here. (pulls a pen from his pocket) I’ve got a pen.
VINDERLOU. (takes pen from Jim) Thanks, darling, I've got to start taking notes here,
I'm not following any of this.
REED. The pen that you gave Troy, where did you get it?
TATANYA. Oh, that pen? I think it was just lying somewhere.
JIM. Laying. It was “laying” somewhere. People lie.
INSPECTOR. Does anyone know what happened to the pen?
TATANYA. He probably put it in his pocket.
INSPECTOR. Hmm. I’ll have to make a call and see if they found it with his personal
effects.
CHAD. Here’s a question...
MIA. Why did I know you would have a question?
CHAD. Do you think the pen was poisoned?
AMBER. They say the pen is mightier than the sword!

39
INSPECTOR. I don’t know if the pen had anything to do with it. It’s just something I
should check.
CHAD. If the pen was lying...
MIA. Laying.
CHAD. ...laying around somewhere, then that would mean, someone had to plant it there.
AMBER. And they would know that Troy would need a pen to fill out the form. He doesn’t
usually need to fill out a form, so he doesn’t carry a pen. But today he did. I always bring
a pen. Because I always have to fill out a form.
INSPECTOR. Troy only touched the form, a pen, and the script in this room. Then when
he heard the word Macbeth, he went out of the room and as far as we know he didn't
touch anything out there.
ALAN. Actually...
MIA. (Interrupts) Are we just going to stand around here all night and play supposition?
JIM. She's got a point. As I said, this plotline has been played. It's too absurd. Even
Ionesco and Beckett would be confused by this whole thing.
CHAD. Who?
JIM. I was thinking perhaps the events here today would give me some ideas for my
murder mystery. A disco dancer that gets murdered by some obscure method. It looks
like an accidental death. A death that’s a metaphor for the changing times. The death of
disco. Maybe that's too much. I should keep it simple. You know, Captain Peacock or
whoever in the drawing-room with the lead pipe. I vote that we call it a night.
VINDERLOU. Vote! That’s it! Vote!
JULIE. I will second the vote.
VINDERLOU. Oh No! Not that voting, darling! (INSPECTOR is confused.) You turn
things back over to the audience. Tear down “the wall” again. The house lights come up.
(lights come up) Not too bright. And we ask them to vote for the person or persons they
think did it!
REED. Right.

40

(ED and BEV describe voting process.)
While voting is happening
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Excuse me! Pardon me! I hate to be Polly Party Pooper, excuse my
French, but it is getting late, and my Julie really needs to be getting her rest.
JULIE. Mother.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. But Julie, the Little Miss Pumpkin Patch Pageant is tomorrow, and
we need to perm your hair.
JULIE. Mom! I am too old for the Little Miss Pumpkin patch pageant! I haven’t been
qualified for a long time! The age limit is 12!
MRS NEEDLEMAN. I know dear but I just thought... well, never mind. Maybe we can
stay a little longer. We’ll see how the voting turns out. Oh! Maybe you won! Wouldn’t that
be something! Stand up straight Julie you’re slouching.
(After all the votes are collected, actors huddle as if they are just learning the ending.)
REED. Inspector, what’s going on?
CHAD. That’s a good question.
INSPECTOR. (she is on cell phone) ...Hmm, I see. Well, thank you very much. (hangs
up) That was the lab. There was a pen in Troy’s pocket, but it was clean.
AMBER. It wasn’t a poison pen?
INSPECTOR. No, it wasn’t.
ALAN. Did they by chance find a small piece of wood?
INSPECTOR. Yes. In his pocket. How did you know about that?
ALAN. That’s part of the superstition. Besides going out of the room and turning around
three times, some believe you have to touch a piece of wood to finalize the ritual.
AMBER. I thought you were supposed to knock on wood.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Wait! I remember something! When I saw him outside the door and I
offered him the cookie, he had something in his hand.

41

INSPECTOR. You saw it in his hand?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Yes. After he did the turning around, I saw him pull a little object
from his pocket. I thought it was a snack and that's what prompted the cookie question. I
thought, if he wants a real treat, I'll offer him a cookie. But he said, "I don't want any of
your..."
INSPECTOR. (interrupts) Yes, we know this part. Let’s get back to the object he was
holding...
MRS NEEDLEMAN. I remember something else odd. I heard him say something to it.
VINDERLOU. You heard him talk to his wood?
CHAD. Maybe he was Wiccan.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. He said something about May or June...
INSPECTOR. May or June?
MIA. He was probably figuring out his busy schedule.
MRS NEEDLEMAN. April! That was it! April! I remember because Julie was born in April!
She was such a beautiful baby. Rosy cheeks and her eyes were just...
JULIE. Mother!
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Do you know that Sondheim song - Where you going, Barcelona,
and her calls her “June” and she sings “April.”
INSPECTOR. Mrs. Needleman, focus! What about April? Do you remember?
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Let me think... what did he say? Something about April. Something
like, “you’re good for something.” I think that was it.
INSPECTOR. He said, “April. You’re good for something.”
MRS NEEDLEMAN. I believe that was it.
JIM. (laughs) I would cut all of this stuff. This business about wood and months of the
year. This is taking everything off in a whole different direction. Why don’t we just call it a
night and...

42

AMBER. April!
VINDERLOU. No darlings, I’m busy in April. Perhaps next January would be good.
AMBER. No, I mean April! Tatanya. April. April. Tatanya.
MIA. Are you coming up with a new stage name right now?
AMBER. No! He called her April! Troy called Tatanya April. Remember? He said, “Come
along, April!”
CHAD. Oh, yea that's right. I remember.
AMBER. So maybe when he was talking to the piece of wood, he thought he was talking
to April.
MIA. Who is actually ... Tatanya.
REED. Why would he say something like that? Is that part of the ritual?
ALAN. No. It sounds more as if he was thanking Tatanya for the object. Looking at the
wood and saying, "You're good for something." Not addressing the wood itself, but
perhaps where it came from.
JIM. This is just getting stupid you guys. I really need to get cracking on the rest of the
show. I’m going to be burning the midnight oil...
INSPECTOR. Why are you so jumpy Jim?
JIM. Me? Jumpy? It’s just my nature, Bonnie. I got ideas poppin’ in my head all the time
and, I don’t know, I guess that makes me seem jumpy. Oh! See that! I just got another
idea for some other show. My mind is always racing. Always jumping.
VINDERLOU. Well, darling, you need to finish this show first. We have read through on
Monday night.
MIA and MRS NEEDLEMAN. The wood!
AMBER. Would what?
CHAD and JULIE. Would what, what?

43
MIA. I’ll bet the piece of wood Troy had in his pocket was coated with some substance
that he was allergic too. That's what did it. That's the thing he touched!
MRS NEEDLEMAN. Told you it wasn’t my cookies.
AMBER. And April, I mean, Tatanya slipped it to him. Just because he was going to ask
me for a ride home. She totally killed him! Didn’t you!? Admit it!
TATANYA. What? Me? Why would I do that? I cared for Troy! Couldn’t you see that?
He... we... he was my boyfriend! Why would I kill him?
AMBER. Wait! No! You said that he wasn’t your boyfriend! He was just using you to drive
him to the Wiggly Piggly place.
TATANYA. I didn’t mean boyfriend, what I meant was that he and I... we... It’s like I said
before...
MIA. You're not a strong improviser, are you? Come on! Just have your cathartic
breakdown and admit your guilt and let's get this over with.
TATANYA. I... I didn’t... Jim! What do I say?
INSPECTOR. Jim?
AMBER. Now she’s trying to throw suspicion elsewhere!
TATANYA. What am I supposed to say now? What are my lines? They’ve figured it out!
INSPECTOR. What are you talking about?
TATANYA. This wasn’t all my idea! It wasn’t supposed to happen like this. This wasn’t in
the script.
INSPECTOR. You know each other? You and Jim?
TATANYA. Tell them Jim. We’ve known each other for years. I was in one of his plays.
He knew Troy too! He sent him an invitation to the auditions.
CHAD. I wondered why a guy like Troy would come to audition like this.
TATANYA. Believe me, he didn’t want to. I told him it would help his career. I encouraged
him to come here. I drove him here.

44

INSPECTOR. I don’t understand.
VINDLERLOU. I was just about to say the same thing darling. These endings always
confuse me.
JIM. But this isn’t the ending I was looking for. I never would have written it this way.
VINDERLOU. Well, how does it end?
INSPECTOR. I’d like to understand the beginning. Jim?
JIM. First, you've got this big talent-less windbag named Troy, who happens to have an
amazing amount of influence in the theatre. I fired him from a show I had written. The
same show where I met Tatanya. Troy made some phone calls, and I was blacklisted. I'm
banished to amateur theatre groups like you and these hokey murder mysteries. It's all I
could get produced. And then the well ran dry. I just couldn't think anymore. I needed
some type of stimulus. Inspiration.
INSPECTOR. How does T---- fit into this?
EVERYONE EXCEPT TATANYA (+AUDIENCE). IT’S TANTANYA!
JIM. Cut to a scene where I run into her one night. We started talking and sharing our
collective dislike for a particular actor in the area...
TATANYA. And then we came up with this plot to lure Troy to this audition. I knew he had
severe allergies and superstitions. We worked everything out right down to replacing his
little piece of lucky wood.
VINDERLOU. Jim, darling, we all hated Troy, but did you have to kill him?
JIM. I didn't think he would die from it. I thought he would just swell up, turn red and look
like an idiot. But when I realized what happened, that he died, well, I thought, what a
great idea for a murder mystery! I wonder if anyone can figure this one out.
INSPECTOR. This was just ruse for your own gain!
MIA. How perfect. The writer!
AMBER. What?
MIA. Isn't it, in reality, the writer who commits the murder through his ideas and his
words? If you consider it, Agatha Christie killed hundreds of people with just one
sentence.

45

CHAD. You were just getting ideas from our ideas?
JIM. I needed to finish my play. And what better than with an actual investigation. That's
why I invited you, Bonnie. I’m so sorry, Tatanya. I didn't mean to get you this far involved.
AMBER. I get it! Things lay, people lie! He was lying this whole time.
MIA. Oh Bravo.
INSPECTOR. (into phone) This is Inspector Bravura. I need a transport unit at (gives
address). I have two in custody. (beat) Homicide. (leads Jim and Tatanya toward doors)
VINDERLOU. Jim? Darling? When can we expect the rest of the script?
JIM. Oh, I should be able to knock it out in a few days. I think I'll have some time
available, and I got some great ideas. I'm not a big fan of the ending right now, though.
(and then to TATANYA as they exit) Hey, I’ve got it! What if the Francois guy doesn’t die
from an allergic reaction, but from a poison dart. Like from some rare newt venom or
something...etc. until they exit
CHAD. Here’s a question, do these auditions count?
MIA. Do you really think there's going to be a show, in spite of everything that's
happened?
VINDERLOU. Of course, there’s always a show! Especially now - whether it's finished or
not, darlings.
REED. What are you talking about?
VINDERLOU. I'm talking about the publicity! Think about it! When people learn what
happened here today, there will be lines around the corner to see it! The murder mystery
by the killer playwright.
AMBER. Do you think I can have a part in it?
MIA. Well, if you don’t, there’s always the auditions at the rep.
AMBER. What auditions?
CHAD & MIA. FOR MACBETH!
Everyone reacts a la Troy and leaves.
